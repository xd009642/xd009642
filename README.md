**Hello ðŸ‘‹** 

London-based software engineer doing Rust stuff. Currently at an AI startup,
previously in defence and aerospace.

**Projects**

If you know me you probably know me for [tarpaulin](https://github.com/xd009642/tarpaulin)
a Rust code coverage tool. It's my main project outside of work but
occasionally I do other things.

**Blog**

I have a infrequently maintained blog [here](https://xd009642.github.io/). I've been
posting a bit more recently about various things I've been doing both tarpaulin and
non-tarpaulin.

**Talk(s)**

At Rustnation 2024 but I spoke on making an open source TTS engine
in Rust. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/xd009642/xd-tts) and
the talk recording [here](https://youtu.be/HiqId_9pysM?si=wX0H67BmPdZwF8v-)

During the pandemic I spoke remotely at the Rust London takeover for data science
where I spoke a bit about one of Emotech's education products for language learners: 
[Multimodal Pronunciation Assessment in Rust](https://youtu.be/EGlilM0Dtu8?si=_dWtg5HZRx4boI5x&t=4949)
